# State-GDP-Literacy-Analysis

This project analyzes the GDP growth, literacy rate, and their correlation across Indian states using:
- 📊 Power BI Dashboard (`Live_Web.pbix`)
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook (`Live_Web.ipynb`)
- 📁 Cleaned Dataset (`Merged_Data (1).csv`)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Maharashtra is the economic powerhouse of India with the highest GDP in 2023–24, contributing ₹40,443 Crore — significantly higher than any other state.

- Kerala has the highest literacy rate (93.91%), but it’s not in the top 3 richest states. This shows that being well-educated doesn't always mean making the most money.

- On average, states' economies grew by 11.75%, which means overall India saw good growth this year.

- The correlation between GDP and Literacy Rate is -0.39, indicating a weak negative relationship —A state can be rich but not highly educated, or the other way around.

- States like Kerala and Himachal Pradesh don’t have very high GDP, but they have good literacy rates. This means they focus more on people’s education and well-being.

- Rich states usually have big cities and industries, while highly literate states have worked more on education and social progress.
